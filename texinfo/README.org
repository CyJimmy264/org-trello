This section describes how to build and install the TexInfo-format
“org-trello Manual”. TexInfo is the standard documentation format of
the GNU-project and is used by Emacs and org-mode. (org-trello is NOT
part of GNU emacs.) This manual is presented in three formats:

- INFO hyper-linked text format, to read from within Emacs (or with
  “info” at the command-line).
- HTML format, to read with a web-browser.
- PDF format, to read or print nicely-formatted on paper.

This org-trello manual may be installed in a folder on your INFOPATH
and listed in the INFO directory of manuals. You may access the INFO
manual directory of manuals from within Emacs by typing “C-h i d” or
from the command-line using the command “info”.

* Building the Manual
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ALT_TITLE: Building Manual
  :DESCRIPTION: Building the Manual
  :END:
It should not be necessary to rebuild the org-trello manual. The
manual is distributed with all three formats already built and ready
to read. If the org-trello.info, .HTML and .PDF files already exist,
you don’t need to read this section.

This manual was written with Emacs and org-mode as “org-trello.org”,
then exported to TexInfo format as “org-trello.texi” using the Texinfo
exporter included with org-mode. Then, the .texi file should be
converted to .info, .HTML, or .PDF using the commands included with
the Texinfo package.

The “Makefile” includes the commands to mall all three formats when
you invoke it with “make all”. You may also request “make info”, “make
view” (to view the new info manual), “make html” and “make pdf”. For
any of these commands, you must install Texinfo and provide the
location of the Texinfo commands at the top of the “Makefile”.

If you lack Texinfo, you may instead export org-trello.org directly to
.info, .HTML or .PDF using Emacs. Without Texinfo, the resulting HTML or
PDF document will have slight differences and will not have an index.
Texinfo creates a more attractive manual and conforms to GNU style.
* Installing the .info Manual
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ALT_TITLE: Installing Manual
  :DESCRIPTION: Install the .info Manual
  :END:

To install the org-trello.info manual so that it may be used by Emacs’
internal info reader or the command-line “info” command, you must:

1. optionally, use gzip to compress the .info file to .info.gz
2. copy or “install” the .info.gz (or .info) file info a folder listed in INFOPATH
3. use “install-info” to insert the new .info.gz file into info’s “dir”
   file in that folder.

This process is described in the [[info:texinfo#Creating%20an%20Info%20File][Texinfo manual]].

If you edit the top of the “Makefile” to provide the location of the
folder in your INFOPATH where the .info should be installed, the
“Makefile” will execute the gzip, install and install-info commands
when you type “make install”.

Once installed, you may invoke command-line “info” reader or Emacs
internal info reader to view the listing of info manuals. The info
reader assembles the directory from all the “dir” files in the
INFOPATH and may appear different in each reader. Locate “org-trello”
in this list or use “m org-trello” to jump to it.
