#+STARTUP: inlineimages
This section describes how to build and install the TexInfo-format
“org-trello Manual”. TexInfo is the standard documentation format of
the GNU-project and is used by Emacs and org-mode. (org-trello is NOT
part of GNU emacs.) This manual is presented in three formats:
- INFO hyper-linked text format, to read from within Emacs (or with “info”)
- HTML format, to read with a web-browser
- PDF format, to read or print nicely-formatted on paper.
This org-trello manual may be installed in a folder on your INFOPATH
and listed in the INFO directory. You may access INFO manual directory
from within Emacs by typing “C-h i d” or from the command-line using
the command “info”.
* Building the Manual
It should not be necessary to rebuild the org-trello manual. The
manual is distributed with all three formats already built and ready
to read. If the org-trello.info, .HTML and .PDF files already exist,
you don’t need to read this section.

This manual was written with Emacs and org-mode as “org-trello.org”,
then exported to TexInfo format as “org-trello.texi” using the Texinfo
exporter included with org-mode. Then, the .texi file should be
converted to .info, .HTML, or .PDF using the commands included with
the Texinfo package.

If you lack Texinfo, you may instead export org-trello.org directly to
.info .HTML or .PDF from Emacs. Without Texinfo, the resulting HTML or
PDF document will have slight differences and will not have an index.
Texinfo creates the most attractive manual and conforms to GNU style.

* Installing the .info Manual

You may optionally use “gzip” to compress the info file. After you
copy the .info or .info.gz file to a folder in your INFOPATH, you
should use install-info, provided with Texinfo, to insert the .info
file into the directory of info manuals. This process is described in
the [[info:texinfo#Creating%20an%20Info%20File][Texinfo manual]].
