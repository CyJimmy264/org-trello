* TODO Convert release-notes from .md to .org

The release-notes log is currently in GitHub’s favored markdown
format, but GitHub can also display org-mode format. Changing
release-notes.md to release-notes.org (already prettified in the
texinfo folder) will permit the Manual to INCLUDE directly from the
project’s release notes, not a separately maintained copy of it.

- [ ] Update the link to release-notes.org in the manual

* HOLD Replace README.md with rewritten README.org

  - Note [2019-01-30 Wed 12:32] by danielb \\
    Hold until the manual is complete and approved.

Replace README.md with a new README.org (for easier maintenance) with
a Table of Contents that references the HTML manual sections directly.
Also reference the legacy documentation for as long as it exists.

* DONE Separate Release Notes Document
  CLOSED: [2019-02-01 Fri 20:45]

The release notes section is very long and is low-priority information. Separate
this section into its own document and link to the .org file (not
HTML).

Remove the Release Notes and #+INCLUDE from the org-trello.org file.
