* WORK Convert release-notes from .md to .org

The existing release-notes log is currently in GitHub’s flavored
markdown format. However, this projects author and users are org-mode
users and GitHub can also render org-mode format. As the release-notes
originate in the org-format TODO list, lets just stay in that format.

- [X] Convert the release-notes.md to texinfo/release-notes.org (for review)
- [X] Reference the release-notes file in the manual.
- [ ] Remove the existing release-notes.md file and move the .org file there.
- [ ] Update the link to release-notes.org in the manual

* HOLD Replace README.md with rewritten README.org

  - Note [2019-01-30 Wed 12:32] by danielb \\
    Hold until the manual is complete and approved.

Replace README.md with a new README.org (for easier maintenance) with
a Table of Contents that references the HTML manual sections directly.
Also reference the legacy documentation for as long as it exists.

* WORK Convert README-dev.md to README-dev.org
Convert the developer’s README-dev.md to .org format for inclusion in
the manual. Remove the .md file and move the .org file up to the main
folder. Fix the include in the org-trello.org manual.
* DONE Separate Release Notes Document
  CLOSED: [2019-02-01 Fri 20:45]

The release notes section is very long and is low-priority information. Separate
this section into its own document and link to the .org file (not
HTML).

Remove the Release Notes and #+INCLUDE from the org-trello.org file.
* Create texinfo/README.org to reference texinfo instructions

- [ ] Write build and install instructions for texinfo in a README.org
- [ ] INCLUDE the instructions in a section of the manual
