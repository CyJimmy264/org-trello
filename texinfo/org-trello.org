- Why use =org-trello=?

  - You use Emacs [[https://orgmode.org][org-mode]].
  - Your team uses [[https://trello.com/][Trello.com]].
  - =org-trello= is the bridge between org-mode and Trello.com.
  - Everyone wins!

- Links:

  - [[https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/zipball/master][Download Zip]]
  - [[https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/tarball/master][Download Tarball]]
  - [[https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello][View on GitHub]]

- What does your page title =org <$> trello= mean?

  It means “map org functions to the trello world”.

  At the time, I was learning Haskell and it made an everlasting
  awesome impression on me. [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.1.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:fmap][See fmap's documentation for more detail]].

This section describes how to use =package= to install =org-trello=.

*** Using MELPA with Package
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Using MELPA
:DESCRIPTION: Using MELPA with Package
:END:
This section describes how to use =package= to download and install any
packages including =org-trello=. If you already use =package= to access
“melpa” or “melpa-stable”, you don’t need to do this again. See the
next section for how to install =org-trello=.

[[https://melpa.org][MELPA.org]] is a large repository of ready-to-install Emacs packages.
There are two flavors: melpa and melpa-stable. Melpa usually contains
the bleeding-edge version of each package. Melpa-stable should contain
the last stable releases of the same packages, but the two may be the
same. Use Melpa if you like to help test the latest features. Use
Melpa-Stable if you want something that just works.

Add the code snippet below (from [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][melpa.org]]) to your Emacs startup file
(.emacs or .emacs.d/init.el). The Melpa repository is pre-selected. If
you prefer Melpa-stable, comment out the line for Melpa and un-comment
the line for Melpa-stable.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; https://melpa.org/#/getting-started
  (require 'package)
  (let* ((no-ssl (and (memq system-type '(windows-nt ms-dos))
                      (not (gnutls-available-p))))
         (proto (if no-ssl "http" "https")))

    ;; Comment/uncomment these two lines to enable/disable MELPA and MELPA Stable as desired
    (add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "melpa" (concat proto "://melpa.org/packages/")) t)
    ;;(add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "melpa-stable" (concat proto "://stable.melpa.org/packages/")) t)
    (when (< emacs-major-version 24)
      ;; For important compatibility libraries like cl-lib
      (add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "gnu" (concat proto "://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))))
  (package-initialize)
#+end_src

After you add this code snippet, exit and restart Emacs or use ~M-x eval-buffer~ to
re-evaluate your initialization file.

*** Installing from MELPA with Package
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Installing from MELPA
:DESCRIPTION: Installing from MELPA with Package
:END:
This section describes how to download and install =org-trello= once you
have installed Package and configured it to access MELPA.

To load the latest package list from MELPA, type ~M-x package-refresh-contents~.

To install =org-trello= from Melpa, type ~M-x package-install RET org-trello RET~.

Once you have installed the package, please see [[#loading-org-trello][Loading =org-trello= in Emacs]].

** Alternate Ways to Install
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Alternate Installations
:DESCRIPTION: Alternate Ways to Install
:END:

This section describes alternate ways to install if you do not use
Package and Melpa as recommended.

/Note/ org-trello's [[http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/org-trello][Marmalade package]] is no longer maintained. Use
[[http://melpa-stable.milkbox.net/#/org-trello][melpa-stable package]] instead.

*** Download and Install the Tarball
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Tarball
:DESCRIPTION: Download and Install the Tarball
:END:

To retrieve the tarball from [[https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/releases][github]], type this at the command line,
substituting the /path/to your chosen folder.
Replace “0.8.1” with the current version, if different.

#+begin_src shell
  VERSION="0.8.1"
  wget https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/releases/download/$VERSION/org-trello-$VERSION.tar -o /path/to/org-trello-$VERSION.tar
#+end_src

Alternately, navigate to [[https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello][=org-trello= on github]] with a browser and click
on the “releases” link, then locate and download the same file.

Then, inside Emacs, type ~M-x package-install-file RET
/path/to/org-trello-0.8.1.tar RET~

*** Get and Install with el-get
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: el-get
:DESCRIPTION: Get and Install with el-get
:END:

If you use [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]] to install packages, you may install the [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get/blob/master/recipes/org-trello.rcp][=org-trello= recipe]]
with it. Inside Emacs, type: ~M-x el-get-install RET org-trello RET~.

*** Clone from GitHub and Install with Cask
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: GitHub & Cask
:DESCRIPTION: Clone from GitHub and Install with Cask
:END:

Use this section only if you are a developer modifying and testing =org-trello=.

Clone =org-trello= from GitHub:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    git clone http://github.com/org-trello/org-trello.git
#+END_SRC

You can use [[https://cask.github.io/][Cask]] to make a local tarball and then install using Emacs:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    make install package
#+END_SRC

/Note/ =install= will download Cask and =package= will create an
=org-trello= tarball archive containing =org-trello=.

Now install the built =org-trello-$VERSION.tar= using Emacs. Type:

~M-x package-install-file RET /path/to/org-trello-$VERSION.tar RET~

** Loading =org-trello= in Emacs
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Loading
:DESCRIPTION: Loading =org-trello= in Emacs
:CUSTOM_ID: loading-org-trello
:END:
Once =org-trello= is installed, it must be loaded into Emacs before it
can be used, preferably during initialization of Emacs. Add this in
your emacs configuration file (“~/.emacs” or “~/.emacs.d/init.el”) to
load =org-trello= when Emacs starts:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'org-trello)
#+END_SRC

/Note/ We do not recommend starting ~org-trello-mode~ for every org-mode buffer
(see https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/issues/209). =org-trello= is
an org minor mode that adds trello abilities that unfortunately limit
org's power. It should only be applied to buffers synced with trello.com.

There is a variable to activate =org-trello= only for specific files:

For example: to activate =org-trello= when opening =/path/to/file0=
and =/path/to/file1=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-variables '(org-trello-files '("/path/to/file0" "/path/to/file1")))
#+END_SRC

** Migrating to New Releases
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: migration
:ALT_TITLE: Migrating
:DESCRIPTION: Migrating to New Releases
:END:
If you have previously installed and used a previous release of
=org-trello=, this section describes how to migrate your existing
=org-trello= installation to a new release.

*** Migrate to 0.8.1
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 081
:END:

The =org-trello= key properties used in the buffer were clashing with
higher org-mode functionality (lookup, cf.
https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/issues/366).

Those properties were renamed with clash free names (=-= separator
symbol was replaced with =_=).

To help the migration, a routine has been integrated. This should not be
needed by the user though (the migration is integrated to the actions).
Still, if the user wants it, (s)he can do it through ~M-x
org-trello-migrate-buffer~.

*** Migrate to 0.7.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 070
:END:

As of now, =org-trello= respects elisp conventions regarding the setup
file location. So the default /~/.trello// will be moved silently to
/~/.emacs.d/.trello//

Also, now users can use multiple trello accounts. So, provided you have
multiple accounts, some commands will ask you when they need you to
choose an account. Also, a silent migration will occur to existing
buffers. For example, if you have a buffer setup-ed with a user /tony/,
your existing configuration file /~/.trello/config.el/ will be moved to
/~/.emacs.d/.trello/tony.el/

Again, =org-trello= tries to respect elisp conventions regarding command
names. So the command names have been renamed from /org-trello// to
/org-trello-/. Still, the old command names are available.

*** Migrate to 0.6.7
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 067
:END:

The comments are now displayed inline in the card. So the binding to
show the comments have been removed. To see comments, simply unfold the
card.

*** Migrate to 0.6.6
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 066
:END:

We can now remove a comment at point (if we are the owner of the
comment). Use ~M-x org-trello-delete-card-comment~.

*** Migrate to 0.5.5
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 055
:END:

Default bindings have been updated.

| Bindings  | Action                                                                               |
|-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C-c o C   | Add comments to the cards at point.                                                  |
|           | To show the cards comments, use ~C-u M-x org-trello-add-card-comments~ (C-u C-c o C) |
| +C-c o o+ | Removed. To show the cards comments, use C-u C-c o C                                 |

Of course, as usual, if you are not happy with this, simply update [[file:bindings.html#bindings-override][your configuration file]].

*** Migrate to 0.5.3
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 053
:END:

Lots of work has been done to make =org-trello=:

- more responsive (almost no more blocking actions).
- faster (trello queries have been improved to let the trello servers do
  the computations)

Default [[http://org-trello.github.io/bindings.html#keybindings][interactive commands]] names have been renamed to be explicit
and aligned between them.

*** Migrate to 0.5.2
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 052
:END:

Decision has been taken to remove the intermediary proxy used to bounce
requests to trello. This was introduced to permit asynchronous requests.
This was only partially applied. So too many lines of code to maintain
for small benefits.

This version is synchronous as it was in the beginning (The base code is
not the same though).

This is a temporary setback. We need time to craft a better
implementation for asynchronous requests (deferred, async libraries
seems interesting enough).

*** Migrate to 0.3.8
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 038
:END:

=org-trello= now tries to enforce symmetry, mainly regarding the sync
actions. So by default, an action pushes to trello. Using C-u, the
symmetric action pulls from trello.

| Bindings      | Action                                              |
|---------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| C-c o c       | sync the entity TO trello without its structure     |
| C-u C-c o c   | sync the entity FROM trello without its structure   |
| C-c o C       | sync the entity and its structure TO trello         |
| C-u C-c o C   | sync the entity and its structure FROM trello       |
| C-c o s       | sync the buffer TO trello                           |
| C-u C-c o s   | sync the buffer FROM trello                         |
| C-c o a       | assign yourself to the card                         |
| C-u C-c o a   | unassign yourself from the card                     |

*** Migrate to 0.3.1
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 031
:END:

The old checklist/item format has been removed -
https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/issues/105. Now the org
checkbox way is the standard one.

*** Migrate to 0.2.9
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 029
:END:

For information, from 0.2.9 onward, the property “orgtrello-id” from the
checkbox (checklists, items) will be hidden.

/Note/

- Upon activating =org-trello= minor mode, all existing checkbox will be
  migrated and should disappear before your eyes.
- Symmetrically, when deactivating =org-trello=, all checkbox will appear.
- For this, =org-trello= use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Overlays.html][overlays]]
  (implementation detail which permits to hide buffer region).

If you began to use =org-trello=, nothing to do.

*** Migrate to 0.2.8
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 028
:END:

From 0.2.8 onward, the card description can be synchronized too. Just
synchronize as usual.

*** Migrate 0.2.1 to 0.2.2
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 021---022
:END:

From the 0.2.2 version onward, we can assign people to card. As a
pre-requisite, we need to re-install the board (C-c o I), so that new
properties will be installed (users currently assigned to the board we
attach to).

This way, you will be able to use the assign (C-c o a) / unassign (C-c o
u) yourself to the card.

*** Migrate 0.1.5 to 0.1.6
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 015---016
:END:

=org-trello= now uses more natural ways of dealing with checklists using
checkboxes!

cf. [[file:migration.html#natural-org-format-from-016-onwards][natural org format (from 0.1.6 onwards)]] for more details.

*** Migrate 0.1.1 to 0.1.2
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 011---012
:END:

- From version 0.1.1, some http requests will be asynchronous. For this,
  we use elnode as a proxy server to make requests to trello. The elnode
  server is started on the port 9876. You can always change this port

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq *ORGTRELLO-PROXY-PORT* 9876)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then M-x orgtrello-proxy/reload

** Installing Your Trello.com Credentials
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Installing Credentials
:DESCRIPTION: Installing Your Trello.com Credentials
:CUSTOM_ID: installing-credentials
:END:

You must install the ~org-trello-consumer-key~ and the read-write
~org-trello-access-token~ to permit org-trello to access your trello
boards.

/Remark:/ This procedure only needs to be done once unless you revoke
the token.

First, ensure that:
- emacs is configured to use an external web browser. Text-only web
  browsers internal to Emacs, like =eww=, =w3= or =w3m-mode=, can not
  execute the required JavaScript.
- the web browser emacs is configured to use is started
- you are logged into Trello.
- you know your exact Trello account name. *DO NOT* use your
  email address as your account name. To confirm your account name,
  check that https://trello.com/*your-account-name* exists.

Then, in Emacs, type:
- ~C-c o i~, or 
- ~M-x org-trello-install-key-and-token~

This command will:

- ask for an account name, which must be your trello login. *DO NOT* use your
  email address as your account name.

- open your browser for you to select and copy your
  /org-trello-consumer-key/ (Developer API Keys / key entry) and paste
  it inside emacs' minibuffer (hit RET when done).

[[file:images/retrieve-consumer-key.png]]

- open a second tab to ask you to authorize org-trello to work in your
  name on your account

[[file:images/authorize-org-trello.png]]

- If you are not ok with this, hit /Deny/. You won't be
  able to use org-trello.

- Otherwise, hit /Allow/, this will then present you a form with the
  read/write /org-trello-access-token/, select and copy it, then paste it
  inside emacs' minibuffer and hit RET.

/Note:/ This command, if accepted, results in a file stored /only/ on
your disk in ~/.emacs.d/.trello/.el</kbd> (this path may vary depending
on **user-emacs-directory**).

This file contains your credentials and will be used to identify you
when requesting trello.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq org-trello-consumer-key "abc...")  ;; 32 characters string
    (setq org-trello-access-token "def...")  ;; 64 characters string

:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Connect Existing Board
:DESCRIPTION: Connect a Buffer to an Existing board
:END:
For each org-mode file that you wish to use with Trello.com, you need
to connect your org-mode file with a Trello board.

/Remarks:/ This procedure must be done only once for each org-mode file you want to
sync with a trello board.

To connect an buffer to an existing board, type:

- ~C-c o I~, or 
- ~M-x org-trello-install-board-metadata~

This will:

- ask you for the accounts you want to use (if you have multiple ones,
  otherwise, it will select the only one and pass to the next step silently)

- present you with a list of boards for the selected account. Select the
  one you want and hit enter.

- edit your org-mode file to add the properties needed.

** Create a Trello board from your org-mode buffer.
:PROPERTIES:

file you want to sync with a trello board.

Type:

- ~C-c o b~, or
- ~M-x org-trello-create-board-and-install-metadata~

This will:

- ask you for the accounts you want to use (if you have multiple ones,
  otherwise, it will select the only one and pass to the next step silently)

- create the Trello board lists from the keywords configured in your

#+CINDEX: customizing
This section describes how you may customize =org-trello=.
** Customizing the Prefix Keybinding
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Prefix Keys
:DESCRIPTION: Customizing the Prefix Keybinding
:END:
#+VINDEX: org-trello-current-prefix-keybinding
By default, =org-trello= uses the prefix keybinding “C-c o” to begin
(almost) all of its commands. You may change this by customizing the
variable ~org-trello-current-prefix-keybinding~.

To customize ~org-trello-current-prefix-keybinding~, type ~C-h v
org-trello-current-prefix-keybinding RET~ to display the help text for this
variable. Then follow the “customize” link on the last line. You
may then use the customize interface to set another prefix keybinding.

/Note:/ If =org-trello= is already running, you must restart emacs after
customizing this variable (or run ~M-x org-trello-mode~ - /twice/).

You may also change this setting in your emacs initialization file.
For example, to change the =org-trello= prefix keybinding to ~C-c x~ add
these lines to your Emacs initialization file (~/.emacs or ~/.emacs.d/.init.el):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-trello)
  (custom-set-variables '(org-trello-current-prefix-keybinding "C-c x"))
#+END_SRC

For an example, please see my [[https://github.com/ardumont/orgmode-pack/blob/master/orgmode-pack.el#L57][startup file]].

:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Individual Keys
:DESCRIPTION: Customizing Individual Key Bindings
:END:
#+VINDEX: org-trello-mode-map
To redefine one or more org-trello-mode command keybindings, you should create a
function to define keys in the org-trello-mode-map and hook your
function to the org-trello-mode-hook. This will make =org-trello= run
your function each time it starts.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

    (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x A") 'org-trello-archive-cards)
    (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x j") 'org-trello-jump-to-trello-card)
    (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x J") 'org-trello-jump-to-trello-board)
    (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x C") 'org-trello-add-card-comments)
    (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x o") 'org-trello-show-card-comments)

  (add-hook 'org-trello-mode-hook 'def-my-org-trello-keys)
#+END_SRC

/Note:/ This will not update the help messages to match your
key-bindings nor remove the default keybindings.

You may add several lines like this one to your hook function to
remove specific existing =org-trello= keybindings:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

You may customize =org-trello= settings by typing: \\

You may customize any of the following variables from the user-interface.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Parent groups: Org

Org-trello group:  Org-trello customisation group.
       State : visible group members are all at standard values.
   
Org Trello Add Tags 
   Add trello colors to org tags list?

Org Trello Current Prefix Keybinding 
   The default prefix keybinding to execute org-trello commands.

Org Trello Files 
   Org-trello files that needs org-trello activated when opened. Hide
   This does not support regular expression.

Org Trello Input Completion Mechanism 
   The completion mechanism the user can choose from. Hide
   Default is the native ido mechanism.
   Other possibilities is helm but it’s up to you to install the dependencies.
   (require ’helm)
   (custom-set-variables ’(org-trello-input-completion-mechanism ’helm))

Org Trello Mode Hook 
   Define org-trello hook for user to extend mode with their own behavior.

Orgtrello Log Level 
   Set log level. Hide
   Levels:
   0 - no log   (‘orgtrello-log-quiet’)
   1 - errors   (‘orgtrello-log-error’)
   2 - warnings (‘orgtrello-log-warn’)
   3 - info     (‘orgtrello-log-info’)
   4 - debug    (‘orgtrello-log-debug’)
   5 - trace    (‘orgtrello-log-trace’)
   To change such level, add this to your init.el file:
   (custom-set-variables ’(orgtrello-log-level orgtrello-log-trace))

Orgtrello Setup Use Position In Checksum Computation 
   Let the user decide if (s)he wants to use the position in the checksum. Hide
   The checksum is a hash computation of the current entity’s data to prevent
   sending too many sync requests if unnecessary (no real change since last time).
   
   If t, when sync to trello, any change for the current entity will be reflected
   in trello’s board.  However, a global sync to trello, will trigger many
   unnecessary sync to trello queries for any entity below the current entity
   changed...  Indeed, the position changes anytime you insert or delete a char.
   This renders almost useless the checksum computation.
   
   Cf.  https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello-issues/271.
   Please, do not hesitate to provide a better idea or a better implementation.
   
   If nil, the default, the sync to trello will be limited to what’s really changed
   (except for the position).  So the entity’s position in trello’s board can be
   slightly different than the one from the buffer.

Orgtrello With Check On Sensible Actions 
   Some action can be dangerous removing entity for example. Hide
   This custom determine if the user wants to be asked confirmation
   before doing some of those sensitive actions.

#+END_SRC

To set these variables for the current session, place the cursor after
the entire s-exp and evaluate it using “M-x eval-last-sexp”.

To make these settings permanent in later sessions, put this code
