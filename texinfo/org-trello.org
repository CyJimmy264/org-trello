This section describes how to use =package= to install =org-trello=.

*** CHEK Using MELPA with Package
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Using MELPA
:DESCRIPTION: Using MELPA with Package
:END:
This section describes how to use =package= to download and install any
packages including org-trello. If you already use =package= to access
“melpa” or “melpa-stable”, you don’t need to do this again. See the
next section for how to install =org-trello=.

[[https://melpa.org][MELPA.org]] is a large repository of ready-to-install Emacs packages.
There are two flavors: melpa and melpa-stable. Melpa contains the
bleeding-edge version of each package. Melpa-stable contains the last
stable release. Use Melpa if you like to help test the latest
features. Use Melpa-Stable if you want something that just works.

Add the code snippet below (from [[https://melpa.org/#/getting-started][melpa.org]]) to your Emacs startup file
(.emacs or .emacs.d/init.el). The Melpa repository is pre-selected. If
you prefer Melpa-stable, comment out the line for Melpa and un-comment
the line for Melpa-stable.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; https://melpa.org/#/getting-started
  (require 'package)
  (let* ((no-ssl (and (memq system-type '(windows-nt ms-dos))
                      (not (gnutls-available-p))))
         (proto (if no-ssl "http" "https")))
    (when no-ssl
      (warn "\
  Your version of Emacs does not support SSL connections,
  which is unsafe because it allows man-in-the-middle attacks.
  There are two things you can do about this warning:
  1. Install an Emacs version that does support SSL and be safe.
  2. Remove this warning from your init file so you won't see it again."))
    ;; Comment/uncomment these two lines to enable/disable MELPA and MELPA Stable as desired
    (add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "melpa" (concat proto "://melpa.org/packages/")) t)
    ;;(add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "melpa-stable" (concat proto "://stable.melpa.org/packages/")) t)
    (when (< emacs-major-version 24)
      ;; For important compatibility libraries like cl-lib
      (add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "gnu" (concat proto "://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")))))
  (package-initialize)
#+end_src

After you add this snippet, restart Emacs or use ~M-x eval-buffer~ to
re-evaluate your initialization file.

*** CHEK Installing from MELPA with Package
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Installing from MELPA
:DESCRIPTION: Installing from MELPA with Package
:END:
This section describes how to download and install org-trello once you
have installed Package and configured it to access MELPA.

To load the latest package list from MELPA, type ~M-x package-refresh-contents~.

To install org-trello from Melpa, type ~M-x package-install RET org-trello RET~.

Once you have installed the package, please see [[*Loading org-trello in Emacs][Loading org-trello in Emacs]].

** CHEK Alternate Ways to Install
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Alternate Installations
:DESCRIPTION: Alternate Ways to Install
:END:

This section describes alternate ways to install if you do not use
Package and Melpa as recommended.

/Note/ org-trello's [[http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/org-trello][Marmalade package]] is no longer maintained. Use
[[http://melpa-stable.milkbox.net/#/org-trello][melpa-stable package]] instead.

*** CHEK Download and Install the Tarball
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Tarball
:DESCRIPTION: Download and Install the Tarball
:END:

To retrieve the tarball from [[https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/releases][github]], type this at the command line:

#+begin_src shell
  $VERSION="0.8.0"
  wget https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/releases/download/$VERSION/org-trello-$VERSION.tar -o /path/to/org-trello-$VERSION.tar
#+end_src

Alternately, navigate to [[https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello][org-trello on github]] with a browser and click
on the “releases” link, locate and download the same file.

Then, inside Emacs, type ~M-x package-install-file RET
/path/to/org-trello-0.8.0.tar RET~

In the commands above, replace “0.8.0” with the current version, if different.

*** CHEK Get and Install with el-get
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: el-get
:DESCRIPTION: Get and Install with el-get
:END:

If you use [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get][el-get]] to install packages, you may install [[https://github.com/dimitri/el-get/blob/master/recipes/org-trello.rcp][org-trello]]
with it. Inside Emacs, type: ~M-x el-get-install RET org-trello RET~.

*** CHEK Clone from GitHub and Install with Cask
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: GitHub & Cask
:DESCRIPTION: Clone from GitHub and Install with Cask
:END:

Use this section only if you are a developer modifying and testing org-trello.

Clone org-trello from GitHub:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    git clone http://github.com/org-trello/org-trello.git
#+END_SRC

You can use [[https://cask.github.io/][Cask]] to make a local tarball and then install using Emacs:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
    make install package
#+END_SRC

/Note/ =install= will download Cask and =package= will create an
org-trello tarball archive containing org-trello.

Now install the built =org-trello-$VERSION.tar= using Emacs. Type:

~M-x package-install-file RET /path/to/org-trello-$VERSION.tar RET~

** CHEK Loading org-trello in Emacs
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Loading
:DESCRIPTION: Loading org-trello in Emacs
:END:
Once org-trello is installed, it must be loading during initialization
of Emacs. Add this in your emacs configuration file “~/.emacs” or
“~/.emacs.d/init.el” to load org-trello when Emacs starts:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (require 'org-trello)
#+END_SRC

/Note/ We do not recommend loading org-trello for every org-mode buffer
(see https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/issues/209). org-trello is
an org minor mode with trello abilities that unfortunately limit
org's power. It should only be applied to buffers synced with trello.com.

There is a variable to activate org-trello only for specific files:

For example: to activate =org-trello= when opening =/path/to/file0=
and =/path/to/file1=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-variables '(org-trello-files '("/path/to/file0" "/path/to/file1")))
#+END_SRC

** Migrating to New Releases
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: migration
:ALT_TITLE: Migrating
:DESCRIPTION: Migrating to New Releases
:END:
If you have previously installed and used a previous release of
org-trello, this section describes how to migrate your existing
org-trello installation to a new release.

*** 0.8.1
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 081
:END:

The org-trello key properties used in the buffer were clashing with
higher org-mode functionality (lookup, cf.
https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/issues/366).

Those properties were renamed with clash free names (=-= separator
symbol was replaced with =_=).

To help the migration, a routine has been integrated. This should not be
needed by the user though (the migration is integrated to the actions).
Still, if the user wants it, (s)he can do it through M-x
org-trello-migrate-buffer.

*** 0.7.0
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 070
:END:

As of now, org-trello respects elisp conventions regarding the setup
file location. So the default /~/.trello// will be moved silently to
/~/.emacs.d/.trello//

Also, now users can use multiple trello accounts. So, provided you have
multiple accounts, some commands will ask you when they need you to
choose an account. Also, a silent migration will occur to existing
buffers. For example, if you have a buffer setup-ed with a user /tony/,
your existing configuration file /~/.trello/config.el/ will be moved to
/~/.emacs.d/.trello/tony.el/

Again, org-trello tries to respect elisp conventions regarding command
names. So the command names have been renamed from /org-trello// to
/org-trello-/. Still, the old command names are available.

*** 0.6.7
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 067
:END:

The comments are now displayed inline in the card. So the binding to
show the comments have been removed. To see comments, simply unfold the
card.

*** 0.6.6
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 066
:END:

We can now remove a comment at point (if we are the owner of the
comment). Use M-x org-trello-delete-card-comment

*** 0.5.5
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 055
:END:

Default bindings have been updated.

| Bindings    | Action                                                                                                                   |
|-------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| C-c o C     | Add comments to the cards at point. To show the cards comments, use C-u M-x org-trello-add-card-comments (C-u C-c o C)   |
| +C-c o o+   | Removed. To show the cards comments, use C-u C-c o C                                                                     |

Of course, as usual, if you are not happy with this, simply update
[[file:bindings.html#bindings-override][your configuration file]].

*** 0.5.3
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 053
:END:

Lots of work has been done to make org-trello:

- more responsive (almost no more blocking actions).
- faster (trello queries have been improved to let the trello servers do
  the computations)

Default [[http://org-trello.github.io/bindings.html#keybindings][interactive commands]] names have been renamed to be explicit
and aligned between them.

*** 0.5.2
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 052
:END:

Decision has been taken to remove the intermediary proxy used to bounce
requests to trello. This was introduced to permit asynchronous requests.
This was only partially applied. So too many lines of code to maintain
for small benefits.

This version is synchronous as it was in the beginning (The base code is
not the same though).

This is a temporary setback. We need time to craft a better
implementation for asynchronous requests (deferred, async libraries
seems interesting enough).

*** 0.3.8
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 038
:END:

org-trello now tries to enforce symmetry, mainly regarding the sync
actions. So by default, an action pushes to trello. Using C-u, the
symmetric action pulls from trello.

| Bindings      | Action                                              |
|---------------+-----------------------------------------------------|
| C-c o c       | sync the entity TO trello without its structure     |
| C-u C-c o c   | sync the entity FROM trello without its structure   |
| C-c o C       | sync the entity and its structure TO trello         |
| C-u C-c o C   | sync the entity and its structure FROM trello       |
| C-c o s       | sync the buffer TO trello                           |
| C-u C-c o s   | sync the buffer FROM trello                         |
| C-c o a       | assign yourself to the card                         |
| C-u C-c o a   | unassign yourself from the card                     |

*** 0.3.1
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 031
:END:

The old checklist/item format has been removed -
https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/issues/105. Now the org
checkbox way is the standard one.

*** 0.2.9
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 029
:END:

For information, from 0.2.9 onward, the property “orgtrello-id” from the
checkbox (checklists, items) will be hidden.

/Note/

- Upon activating org-trello minor mode, all existing checkbox will be
  migrated and should disappear before your eyes.
- Symmetrically, when deactivating org-trello, all checkbox will appear.
- For this, org-trello use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Overlays.html][overlays]]
  (implementation detail which permits to hide buffer region).

If you began to use org-trello, nothing to do.

*** 0.2.8
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 028
:END:

From 0.2.8 onward, the card description can be synchronized too. Just
synchronize as usual.

*** 0.2.1 -> 0.2.2
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 021---022
:END:

From the 0.2.2 version onward, we can assign people to card. As a
pre-requisite, we need to re-install the board (C-c o I), so that new
properties will be installed (users currently assigned to the board we
attach to).

This way, you will be able to use the assign (C-c o a) / unassign (C-c o
u) yourself to the card.

*** 0.1.5 -> 0.1.6
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 015---016
:END:

Org-trello now uses more natural ways of dealing with checklists using
checkboxes!

cf. [[file:migration.html#natural-org-format-from-016-onwards][natural org format (from 0.1.6 onwards)]] for more details.

*** 0.1.1 -> 0.1.2
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: 011---012
:END:

- From version 0.1.1, some http requests will be asynchronous. For this,
  we use elnode as a proxy server to make requests to trello. The elnode
  server is started on the port 9876. You can always change this port

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq *ORGTRELLO-PROXY-PORT* 9876)
#+END_EXAMPLE

Then M-x orgtrello-proxy/reload

:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Prefix Keys
:DESCRIPTION: Customizing the Prefix Keybinding
:END:
#+VINDEX: org-trello-current-prefix-keybinding
By default, org-trello uses the prefix keybinding “C-c o” to begin
(almost) all of its commands. You may change this by customizing the
variable “org-trello-current-prefix-keybinding”.

To customize “org-trello-current-prefix-keybinding”, type “C-h v
org-trello-current-prefix-keybinding RET” to display the help text for this
variable. Then follow the “customize” link on the last line. You
may then use the customize interface to set another prefix keybinding.

/Note:/ If org-trello is already running, you must restart emacs after
customizing this variable (or run “M-x org-trello-mode” - /twice/).

You may also change this setting in your emacs initialization file.
For example, to change the org-trello prefix keybinding to “C-c x” add
these lines to your ~/.emacs (or ~/.emacs.d/.init.el) file:

** Customizing Individual Keybindings
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Individual Keys
:DESCRIPTION: Customizing Individual Key Bindings
:END:
#+VINDEX: org-trello-mode-map
To redefine one or more org-trello-mode command keybindings, you should create a
function to define keys in the org-trello-mode-map and hook your
function to the org-trello-mode-hook. This will make org-trello run
your function each time it starts.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-trello)

  (defun def-my-org-trello-keys () "Define my org-trello keys."
    (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x v") 'org-trello-version)
    (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x i") 'org-trello-install-key-and-token)
    (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x I") 'org-trello-install-board-metadata)
    (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x c") 'org-trello-sync-card)
    (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x s") 'org-trello-sync-buffer)
    (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x a") 'org-trello-assign-me)

    (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x j") 'org-trello-jump-to-trello-card)
    (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x J") 'org-trello-jump-to-trello-board)

  (add-hook 'org-trello-mode-hook 'def-my-org-trello-keys)
#+END_SRC

/Note:/ This will not update the help messages to match your
key-bindings nor remove the default keybindings.

You may add several lines like this one to your hook function to
remove specific existing org-trello keybindings:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c o v") nil)
#+END_SRC

** Customizing org-trello Variables
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Variables
:DESCRIPTION: Customizing Variables
:END:

You may customize org-trello settings by typing: \\
“M-x customize-group RET org-trello RET”.

You may customize any of the following variables from the user-interface.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Parent groups: Org

Org-trello group:  Org-trello customisation group.
       State : visible group members are all at standard values.
   
Org Trello Add Tags 
   Add trello colors to org tags list?

Org Trello Current Prefix Keybinding 
   The default prefix keybinding to execute org-trello commands.

Org Trello Files 
   Org-trello files that needs org-trello activated when opened. Hide
   This does not support regular expression.

Org Trello Input Completion Mechanism 
   The completion mechanism the user can choose from. Hide
   Default is the native ido mechanism.
   Other possibilities is helm but it’s up to you to install the dependencies.
   (require ’helm)
   (custom-set-variables ’(org-trello-input-completion-mechanism ’helm))

Org Trello Mode Hook 
   Define org-trello hook for user to extend mode with their own behavior.

Orgtrello Log Level 
   Set log level. Hide
   Levels:
   0 - no log   (‘orgtrello-log-quiet’)
   1 - errors   (‘orgtrello-log-error’)
   2 - warnings (‘orgtrello-log-warn’)
   3 - info     (‘orgtrello-log-info’)
   4 - debug    (‘orgtrello-log-debug’)
   5 - trace    (‘orgtrello-log-trace’)
   To change such level, add this to your init.el file:
   (custom-set-variables ’(orgtrello-log-level orgtrello-log-trace))

Orgtrello Setup Use Position In Checksum Computation 
   Let the user decide if (s)he wants to use the position in the checksum. Hide
   The checksum is a hash computation of the current entity’s data to prevent
   sending too many sync requests if unnecessary (no real change since last time).
   
   If t, when sync to trello, any change for the current entity will be reflected
   in trello’s board.  However, a global sync to trello, will trigger many
   unnecessary sync to trello queries for any entity below the current entity
   changed...  Indeed, the position changes anytime you insert or delete a char.
   This renders almost useless the checksum computation.
   
   Cf.  https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello-issues/271.
   Please, do not hesitate to provide a better idea or a better implementation.
   
   If nil, the default, the sync to trello will be limited to what’s really changed
   (except for the position).  So the entity’s position in trello’s board can be
   slightly different than the one from the buffer.

Orgtrello With Check On Sensible Actions 
   Some action can be dangerous removing entity for example. Hide
   This custom determine if the user wants to be asked confirmation
   before doing some of those sensitive actions.

** Example Emacs-Lisp Customization
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Example
:DESCRIPTION: Example Emacs-Lisp Customization
:END:

Here is an example of how to configure org-trello user-customized
variables using emacs-lisp:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (custom-set-variables
       '(orgtrello-log-level orgtrello-log-debug) ;; log level to debug
       '(org-trello-current-prefix-keybinding "C-c x") ;; C-c x as the default prefix
       '(orgtrello-setup-use-position-in-checksum-computation nil) ;; checksum without position
       '(org-trello-files '("~/docs/some-doc.trello"
                            "~/docs/some-other-doc.org"))) ;; automatic org-trello on files
#+END_SRC

To set these variables for the current session, place the cursor after
the entire s-exp and evaluate it using “M-x eval-last-sexp”.

To make these settings permanent in later sessions, put this code
inside your emacs setup file (“~/.emacs” or “~/emacs.d/init.el”).

** Automatic org-trello Files
:PROPERTIES:
:ALT_TITLE: Auto Files
:DESCRIPTION: Automatic org-trello Files
:END:

To have emacs automatically start org-trello when you open a file with
a “.trello” extension, add this to your personal emacs setup file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; org-trello major mode for all .trello files

  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.trello$" . org-mode))

  ;; add a hook function to check if this is trello file,
  ;; then activate the org-trello minor mode.

  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (let ((filename (buffer-file-name (current-buffer))))
                (when (and filename (string= "trello" (file-name-extension filename)))
                (org-trello-mode)))))

:END:

If you experience an issue while using org-trello, please first
confirm that you have the newest version of org-trello. If you
have an old version, please upgrade to the newest version - your issue
may already have been solved. You may display the version of your copy
of org-trello by typing “C-c o v” or “M-x org-trello-version”.

If you have the newest version, please search the [[https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/issues][issue list]] for
issues similar to yours. If your issue already exists, please describe
your experiences in the comments, if different, and try the
advice offered there, if any.

If you don’t find an issue like yours, you should create a new issue.

You should include the following information in your issue entry:

- Your org-trello version
- Your org-mode version
- Your emacs version
- Your system type and OS version
- How you installed org-trello:
  - melpa
  - melpa-stable
  - el-get

clear, concise and complete in your issue description.

*** Using =M-x org-trello-bug-report=

You may use the bug-report function of org-trello to print some
information about org-trello to the *Messages* buffer to copy into the
issue entry. To print the bug-report data, type “M-x
org-trello-bug-report” or “C-c o B”. Then open the *Messages* buffer
and copy the block of data it produced to paste into the issue on
GitHub. The block of data will resemble:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  System information:
  - system-type: darwin
  - locale-coding-system: utf-8-unix
  - emacs-version: GNU Emacs 26.1
  - org version: 9.2
  - org-trello version: 0.8.0
  - org-trello path: ~/.emacs.d/elpa/org-trello-20180331.631/org-trello.el
  - request-backend: curl
  - kill-whole-line: nil
#+END_EXAMPLE

If you type “C-u C-c o B” instead, org-trello will open a new issue on
GitHub for you to complete.

*** Using =orgtrello-log-trace=

To obtain a more verbose output in the **Message** buffer, you can put
this snippet of code in a =*scratch*= buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-variables '(orgtrello-log-level orgtrello-log-trace))
#+END_SRC

and evaluate it with M-x eval-buffer. Then, return to your org-trello
buffer and repeat the conditions that cause the issue. Copy the
resulting detailed log messages into your bug-report.
