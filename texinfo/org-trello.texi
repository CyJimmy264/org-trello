@lisp
(require 'org-trello)

@node Install Manual
@section Using the org-trello manual

@cindex manual, installing
This section describes how to build and install the TexInfo-format
“org-trello Manual”. TexInfo is the standard documentation format of
the GNU-project and is used by Emacs and org-mode. (org-trello is NOT
part of GNU emacs.) This manual is presented in three formats:

@itemize
@item
INFO hyper-linked text format, to read from within Emacs (or with
“info” at the command-line).
@item
HTML format, to read with a web-browser.
@item
PDF format, to read or print nicely-formatted on paper.
@end itemize

This org-trello manual may be installed in a folder on your INFOPATH
and listed in the INFO directory of manuals. You may access the INFO
manual directory of manuals from within Emacs by typing “C-h i d” or
from the command-line using the command “info”.

@end menu

@node Building Manual
@subsection Building the Manual

It should not be necessary to rebuild the org-trello manual. The
manual is distributed with all three formats already built and ready
to read. If the org-trello.info, .HTML and .PDF files already exist,
you don’t need to read this section.

This manual was written with Emacs and org-mode as “org-trello.org”,
then exported to TexInfo format as “org-trello.texi” using the Texinfo
exporter included with org-mode. Then, the .texi file should be
converted to .info, .HTML, or .PDF using the commands included with
the Texinfo package.

The “Makefile” includes the commands to mall all three formats when
you invoke it with “make all”. You may also request “make info”, “make
view” (to view the new info manual), “make html” and “make pdf”. For
any of these commands, you must install Texinfo and provide the
location of the Texinfo commands at the top of the “Makefile”.

If you lack Texinfo, you may instead export org-trello.org directly to
.info, .HTML or .PDF using Emacs. Without Texinfo, the resulting HTML or
PDF document will have slight differences and will not have an index.
Texinfo creates a more attractive manual and conforms to GNU style.

@node Installing Manual
@subsection Installing the .info Manual

To install the org-trello.info manual so that it may be used by Emacs’
internal info reader or the command-line “info” command, you must:

@enumerate
@item
optionally, use gzip to compress the .info file to .info.gz
@item
copy or “install” the .info.gz (or .info) file info a folder listed in INFOPATH
@item
use “install-info” to insert the new .info.gz file into info’s “dir”
file in that folder.
@end enumerate

This process is described in the @ref{Creating an Info File,Texinfo manual,,texinfo,}.

If you edit the top of the “Makefile” to provide the location of the
folder in your INFOPATH where the .info should be installed, the
“Makefile” will execute the gzip, install and install-info commands
when you type “make install”.

Once installed, you may invoke command-line “info” reader or Emacs
internal info reader to view the listing of info manuals. The info
reader assembles the directory from all the “dir” files in the
INFOPATH and may appear different in each reader. Locate “org-trello”
in this list or use “m org-trello” to jump to it.

@node Migrating

@node 081
@subsection 0.8.1

The org-trello key properties used in the buffer were clashing with
higher org-mode functionality (lookup, cf.
@uref{https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/issues/366}).

Those properties were renamed with clash free names (@samp{-} separator
symbol was replaced with @samp{_}).

To help the migration, a routine has been integrated. This should not be
needed by the user though (the migration is integrated to the actions).
Still, if the user wants it, (s)he can do it through M-x
org-trello-migrate-buffer.

@node 070
@subsection 0.7.0

As of now, org-trello respects elisp conventions regarding the setup
file location. So the default @emph{~}.trello// will be moved silently to
@emph{~}.emacs.d/.trello//

Also, now users can use multiple trello accounts. So, provided you have
multiple accounts, some commands will ask you when they need you to
choose an account. Also, a silent migration will occur to existing
buffers. For example, if you have a buffer setup-ed with a user @emph{tony},
your existing configuration file @emph{~}.trello/config.el/ will be moved to
@emph{~}.emacs.d/.trello/tony.el/

Again, org-trello tries to respect elisp conventions regarding command
names. So the command names have been renamed from @emph{org-trello/} to
@emph{org-trello-}. Still, the old command names are available.

@node 067
@subsection 0.6.7

The comments are now displayed inline in the card. So the binding to
show the comments have been removed. To see comments, simply unfold the
card.

@node 066
@subsection 0.6.6

We can now remove a comment at point (if we are the owner of the
comment). Use M-x org-trello-delete-card-comment

@node 055
@subsection 0.5.5

Default bindings have been updated.

@multitable {aaaaaaaaa} {aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa}
@headitem Bindings
@tab Action
@item C-c o C
@tab Add comments to the cards at point. To show the cards comments, use C-u M-x org-trello-add-card-comments (C-u C-c o C)
@item C-c o o
@tab Removed. To show the cards comments, use C-u C-c o C
@end multitable

Of course, as usual, if you are not happy with this, simply update
@uref{bindings.html#bindings-override, your configuration file}.

@node 053
@subsection 0.5.3

Lots of work has been done to make org-trello:

@itemize
@item
more responsive (almost no more blocking actions).
@item
faster (trello queries have been improved to let the trello servers do
the computations)
@end itemize

Default @uref{http://org-trello.github.io/bindings.html#keybindings, interactive commands} names have been renamed to be explicit
and aligned between them.

@node 052
@subsection 0.5.2

Decision has been taken to remove the intermediary proxy used to bounce
requests to trello. This was introduced to permit asynchronous requests.
This was only partially applied. So too many lines of code to maintain
for small benefits.

This version is synchronous as it was in the beginning (The base code is
not the same though).

This is a temporary setback. We need time to craft a better
implementation for asynchronous requests (deferred, async libraries
seems interesting enough).

@node 038
@subsection 0.3.8

org-trello now tries to enforce symmetry, mainly regarding the sync
actions. So by default, an action pushes to trello. Using C-u, the
symmetric action pulls from trello.

@multitable {aaaaaaaaaaa} {aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa}
@headitem Bindings
@tab Action
@item C-c o c
@tab sync the entity TO trello without its structure
@item C-u C-c o c
@tab sync the entity FROM trello without its structure
@item C-c o C
@tab sync the entity and its structure TO trello
@item C-u C-c o C
@tab sync the entity and its structure FROM trello
@item C-c o s
@tab sync the buffer TO trello
@item C-u C-c o s
@tab sync the buffer FROM trello
@item C-c o a
@tab assign yourself to the card
@item C-u C-c o a
@tab unassign yourself from the card
@end multitable

@node 031
@subsection 0.3.1

The old checklist/item format has been removed -
@uref{https://github.com/org-trello/org-trello/issues/105}. Now the org
checkbox way is the standard one.

@node 029
@subsection 0.2.9

For information, from 0.2.9 onward, the property “orgtrello-id” from the
checkbox (checklists, items) will be hidden.

@emph{Note}

@itemize
@item
Upon activating org-trello minor mode, all existing checkbox will be
migrated and should disappear before your eyes.
@item
Symmetrically, when deactivating org-trello, all checkbox will appear.
@item
For this, org-trello use @uref{https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Overlays.html, overlays}
(implementation detail which permits to hide buffer region).
@end itemize

If you began to use org-trello, nothing to do.

@node 028
@subsection 0.2.8

From 0.2.8 onward, the card description can be synchronized too. Just
synchronize as usual.

@node 021 -> 022
@subsection 0.2.1 -> 0.2.2

From the 0.2.2 version onward, we can assign people to card. As a
pre-requisite, we need to re-install the board (C-c o I), so that new
properties will be installed (users currently assigned to the board we
attach to).

This way, you will be able to use the assign (C-c o a) / unassign (C-c o
u) yourself to the card.

@node 015 -> 016
@subsection 0.1.5 -> 0.1.6

Org-trello now uses more natural ways of dealing with checklists using
checkboxes!

cf. @uref{migration.html#natural-org-format-from-016-onwards, natural org format (from 0.1.6 onwards)} for more details.

@node 011 -> 012
@subsection 0.1.1 -> 0.1.2

@itemize
@item
From version 0.1.1, some http requests will be asynchronous. For this,
we use elnode as a proxy server to make requests to trello. The elnode
server is started on the port 9876. You can always change this port
@end itemize

@example
(setq *ORGTRELLO-PROXY-PORT* 9876)

@node Prefix Keys
@section @strong{CHEK} Customizing the Prefix Keybinding

@vindex org-trello-current-prefix-keybinding
By default, org-trello uses the prefix keybinding “C-c o” to begin
(almost) all of its commands. You may change this by customizing the
variable “org-trello-current-prefix-keybinding”.

To customize “org-trello-current-prefix-keybinding”, type “C-h v
org-trello-current-prefix-keybinding RET” to display the help text for this
variable. Then follow the “customize” link on the last line. You
may then use the customize interface to set another prefix keybinding.

@emph{Note:} If org-trello is already running, you must restart emacs after
customizing this variable (or run “M-x org-trello-mode” - @emph{twice}).

You may also change this setting in your emacs initialization file.
For example, to change the org-trello prefix keybinding to “C-c x” add
these lines to your ~/.emacs (or ~/.emacs.d/.init.el) file:

@lisp
(require 'org-trello)
(custom-set-variables '(org-trello-current-prefix-keybinding "C-c x"))

@vindex org-trello-mode-map
To redefine one or more org-trello-mode command keybindings, you should create a
function to define keys in the org-trello-mode-map and hook your
function to the org-trello-mode-hook. This will make org-trello run
your function each time it starts.

@lisp
(require 'org-trello)

(defun def-my-org-trello-keys () "Define my org-trello keys."
  (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x v") 'org-trello-version)
  (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x i") 'org-trello-install-key-and-token)
  (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x I") 'org-trello-install-board-metadata)
  (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x c") 'org-trello-sync-card)
  (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x s") 'org-trello-sync-buffer)
  (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x a") 'org-trello-assign-me)

  (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x k") 'org-trello-kill-entity)
  (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x K") 'org-trello-kill-cards)

  (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x A") 'org-trello-archive-cards)
  (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x j") 'org-trello-jump-to-trello-card)
  (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x J") 'org-trello-jump-to-trello-board)
  (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x C") 'org-trello-add-card-comments)
  (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x o") 'org-trello-show-card-comments)
  (define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c x l") 'org-trello-show-card-labels)

@emph{Note:} This will not update the help messages to match your
key-bindings nor remove the default keybindings.

You may add several lines like this one to your hook function to
remove specific existing org-trello keybindings:

@lisp
(define-key org-trello-mode-map (kbd "C-c o v") nil)
